# Time Tracking Grid - Project Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Time Tracking Grid project, inspired by the challenge on Frontend Mentor. This project aimed to create a time tracking grid using HTML grid for layout, CSS for styling, and jQuery in JavaScript for interactive features.

## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to design and implement a time tracking grid that provides a user-friendly interface for tracking various tasks. The grid should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid for layout)
- JavaScript (jQuery for interactive features)

### What I Learned

This project allowed me to enhance my skills in utilizing HTML grid for creating responsive layouts. Additionally, incorporating jQuery into the project helped me add dynamic and interactive elements to the time tracking grid.

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I plan to explore more advanced features of CSS Grid and jQuery to further improve the user experience. Additionally, I aim to incorporate server-side functionality to store and retrieve time tracking data.

### Useful Resources
